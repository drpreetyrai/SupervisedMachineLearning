    "# Build a Malware Classification Model Using Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "In a clinical laboratory setting, a large dataset of patient test results has been compiled, including thousands of entries with numerous biological and chemical measurements. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has a particular disease based on a subset of these measurements. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical data, and there are potential correlations among the features that need to be accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hospital's research team has decided to implement a Random Forest classifier to model the disease classification problem. However, due to the large number of features, a feature selection technique is required to identify the most relevant attributes. The team also seeks to evaluate the need for feature scaling and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Random Forest model. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) will be used for feature selection, and GridSearchCV will be employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",

    "Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with building a predictive model for disease classification using the given clinical dataset, which contains thousands of entries with multiple biological measurements. To achieve this, you will:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Load a random sample of 1,000 records from the larger dataset.\n",
    " * Conduct a data quality check, including handling missing values and removing non-numeric columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Implement Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest classifier to select the top 10 most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Train/Test Split:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Split the dataset into training and test sets using a 70/30 ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Train a Random Forest classifier using the selected features.\n",
    " * Evaluate the model’s performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Apply GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Scaling Impact Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Assess the impact of feature scaling by comparing the model's accuracy with and without scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Determine the best model configuration based on hyperparameter tuning and scaling.\n",
