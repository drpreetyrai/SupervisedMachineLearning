    "# Optimizing Loan Approval Predictions Using Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working as a data scientist at a financial institution that specializes in providing loans to individuals. The company has gathered a large dataset of loan applicants, which includes features such as age, income, credit score, and education level. The company wants to predict whether a loan applicant will be approved or denied based on their profile. By building a machine learning model, the company aims to streamline the loan approval process and improve the accuracy of its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model you are tasked with building needs to be both interpretable and efficient, as it will be used in a production environment to process hundreds of applications daily. Your first approach involves using a Gaussian Naive Bayes model due to its simplicity and interpretability. You will evaluate the model, tune its hyperparameters, and assess its final performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist at the financial institution, your goal is to automate the loan approval process using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict loan approval decisions. You have access to a dataset containing features such as age, income, credit score, and education level, along with the target variable Loan_Approval (1 for approval, 0 for rejection).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Handle missing values for features like age and income using appropriate imputation techniques.\n",
    " * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of key variables like age, income, and credit score. Generate visualizations to highlight patterns in the data.\n",
    " * Analyze the distribution of loan approvals to check for class imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Normalize continuous variables such as age, income, and credit score to ensure the model performs optimally.\n",
    " * Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Building and Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the training data and make predictions on the test set.\n",
    " * Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and the confusion matrix. Provide a detailed interpretation of the results."
