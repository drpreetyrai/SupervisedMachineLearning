    "# Automating Drug Prescription with SVM \n",
    "\n",
    "In the pharmaceutical industry, doctors often need to prescribe the correct drug based on a patient's unique medical profile. Factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na_to_K) influence the choice of drug. However, determining the most effective drug can sometimes be complex, especially when multiple factors interact in subtle ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), can assist in this decision-making process by learning patterns from past data and making accurate drug predictions for new patients based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a data scientist working at a pharmaceutical company. The company has developed a system that collects patient data (such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio) when they visit their healthcare providers. Currently, healthcare professionals manually decide which drug is best for each patient based on this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pharmaceutical company wants to enhance this process by automating it with machine learning. Your task is to create an SVM model that can predict the most suitable drug for a patient based on their profile. This model will be used in the company's healthcare app to assist doctors in prescribing drugs more efficiently and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem and Goals:\n",
    "1. Data Understanding and Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the dataset, including features such as age, sex, BP, cholesterol, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio.\n",
    "Preprocess the data, handling categorical variables and scaling numerical features as SVM is sensitive to feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the distribution of the patient features.\n",
    "Understand correlations between features, like how age, cholesterol, and blood pressure relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Development and Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train an initial SVM model with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to classify patients into drug categories.\n",
    "Use the model to predict the drug type based on patient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, and examine the confusion matrix to understand how well the model is classifying patients into the correct drug categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal values for SVM parameters such as C, gamma, and kernel.\n",
    "Retrain the model with the best hyperparameters and reevaluate its performance."
